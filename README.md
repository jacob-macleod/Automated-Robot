# Automated-Robot
A self automated Arduino robot

This intelligent robot uses simple ruleset behaviors to exhibit advanced behaviors. 

In other words, it reverses then rotates when near a wall before moving forward again. This allows the robot to appear to be exploring the environment. It is powers by two servo motors on either side at the rear.
